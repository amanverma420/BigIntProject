# BigIntProject


## Overview
This project implements a Big Integer arithmetic library in C++. It supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arbitrarily large integers that exceed built-in data type limits.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers
- Input and output support for big integers
- Efficient algorithms to handle large number calculations

## How to Use
- Compile the source files using a C++ compiler, e.g.:
g++ BigInt.cpp main.cpp -o BigIntApp
./BigIntApp

- Run the executable and input large integers for calculations.
